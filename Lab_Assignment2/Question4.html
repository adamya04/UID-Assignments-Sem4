        The university was founded with the opening of Amrita School of Engineering, 
        Coimbatore as college under Anna University at Ettimadai village in 1994 
        by Mata Amritanandamayi and is managed by her international humanitarian organisation

    <h2>
        Education for life and living
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are two types of education: education for living and education for life. 
        Studying to become a professional is education for a living, while education for 
        life requires an understanding of the essential human values. At Amrita, we believe 
        that education should also impart a culture of the heart, based on enduring values 
        and inner strength. Amrita's culture of education helps to inculcate in our 
        students the right ethos to be rooted in the values of Dharma (righteousness), 
        Karuna (compassion), and Shraddha (mindfulness).
